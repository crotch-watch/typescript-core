# Introduction

This isn’t ***"just"*** to build some familiarity with TypeScript but a ***comprehensive understanding*** in alignment with the latest features and the modern development practices.

## *Learning Typescript and it's essential features*

1. **Type Declarations & Inference** – Understanding how TypeScript manages types dynamically

2. **Interfaces & Type Aliases** – Writing structured, reusable code with confidence.

3. **Classes & Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in TypeScript.

4. **Decorators** – Implementing powerful meta-programming techniques.

5. **Generics** – Writing scalable, reusable functions and components.

6. **Mapped & Conditional Types** – Taking type safety to the next level.

7. **Modules & Namespaces** – Organizing and structure code efficiently.

8. **TypeScript Compiler (tsc) & Configuration** – Learning how TypeScript compiles into JavaScript and how to configure it for different environments.

9. **Advanced TypeScript Features** – Utility types, infer keyword, keyof operator, and template literal types.

10. **The Inner Workings of TypeScript** – Going under the hood to understand how TypeScript interprets and enforces type safety.
